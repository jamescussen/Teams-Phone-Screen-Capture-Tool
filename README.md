# Teams Phone Screen Capture Tool

Hello, this is a PowerShell based tool for easily screen capturing on a Microsoft Teams Phone device as either a single image or an animated GIF (that you can also edit and markup in the tool). You can read more about it and how to use it on my blog here: https://www.myteamslab.com/2020/10/teams-phone-screen-capture-tool.html
